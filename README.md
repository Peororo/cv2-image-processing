Task : You can choose any colored tape/solid colored rectangular item you can find. The first step is to accurately detect this colored line from a live camera feed. Noise or small objects
of the same color must not affect the detection. The second step is to determine the control signals; depending on the cases listed below, the corresponding control signal has to be
printed on the video output.

This project aims to simulate a line following robot - autonomous vehicles that can detect a visual line usually embedded on the floor
and keep following it.
